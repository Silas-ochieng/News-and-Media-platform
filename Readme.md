## Running the Project

### Development Mode

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-and-media-beta.git
   cd news-and-media-beta
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure your `.env` file with development settings:
   ```
   DEBUG=True
   ENVIRONMENT=development
   ```

5. Run migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create a superuser:
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. Run the development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. Access the site at: http://127.0.0.1:8000

### Production Mode

1. Configure your `.env` file with production settings:
   ```
   DEBUG=False
   ENVIRONMENT=production
   ```

2. Collect static files:
   ```
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

3. Run the production server using Waitress:
   ```
   python waitress_server.py
   ```
   

   This will start a production-ready server at http://localhost:8000

4. Deploying to Render:
   - Go to https://render.com/ and sign up or log in.
   - Create a new Web Service and connect your GitHub repository.
   - Set the build command to:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt; python manage.py collectstatic --noinput; python manage.py migrate
     ```
   - Set the start command to:
     ```
     python waitress_server.py
     ```
   - Add all environment variables from your `.env` file in the Render dashboard.
   - After deployment, update `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in your Render environment variables to match your Render domain (e.g., `https://your-app.onrender.com`).
   - Render will provide a public URL for your app.
   - For custom domains, follow Render's documentation to set up SSL/TLS and domain mapping.

## Troubleshooting

### CSRF Verification Failed

If you encounter CSRF verification errors:

1. Check your `.env` file has properly configured `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`:
   ```
   CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com,https://*.your-domain.com
   ```

2. Ensure all URLs in `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` start with `https://` or `http://`

3. If using a custom domain, make sure it's included in both:
   - `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
   - `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`

4. For local development behind a proxy, add your local URL:
   ```
   CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com,http://localhost:8000
   ```

5. Verify your templates include the `{% csrf_token %}` tag in all forms

### Static Files Issues

If static files aren't loading correctly:

1. Run `python manage.py collectstatic`
2. Check that the `STATIC_ROOT` directory exists
3. Ensure `STATICFILES_STORAGE` is properly configured in `settings.py`
4. In production, configure your web server to serve static files

### Email Verification Problems

If email verification isn't working:

1. Test your email configuration with the provided script:
   ```
   python test_email_config.py
   ```

2. Check that your Google account has 2-Factor Authentication enabled and you're using App Passwords
3. Verify email settings in your `.env` file
4. Check application logs for detailed error messages
